# PG Model Viewer

A standalone desktop app that renders **real Project: Gorgon item models** with
the game's live **1/2/3-channel dye** system, plus a **paper-doll** character
mode that assembles a full loadout onto a base body.

Extracted from [glogger](https://github.com/crisp-oddio/glogger-oddio) — this is
the 3D Model Viewer feature as its own app.

## What it does

- Browse equippable items by slot (Head / Chest / Legs / Hands / Feet / Main /
  Off-hand) and view their actual in-game 3D model on a turntable.
- Recolor each piece live with Project: Gorgon's `Gorgon/Character` dye shader
  (single / double / triple dye), replicated in three.js.
- **Character mode**: dress a naked base body slot-by-slot and see the whole
  loadout assembled and dyed.

## How it works

```
PG CDN items.json  ──▶  item → EquipAppearance2 directive  (game_data/appearance.rs)
                          │  @Chest=@eq-{sex}2-chest-leather-01(^Armor=…%DYE%)
                          ▼
local Unity bundles  ──▶  extractor (tools/model_extractor/extract.py)
  (your PG install)        → {appdata}/models/  meshes/*.glb + textures/*.png + catalog.json
                          ▼
three.js viewer      ──▶  mesh geometry + dye ShaderMaterial (live recolor via uniforms)
```

- **Item data** comes from the public PG CDN (`items.json`), fetched and cached
  on first launch — no game files needed for browsing.
- **3D geometry + textures** are extracted from **your own local Project: Gorgon
  install** (unencrypted Unity 6.3 Addressable bundles) into a local cache. No
  game art is redistributed.

## Requirements

- Node 18+, Rust (stable), and the Tauri 2 prerequisites for your OS.
- **Python 3** with `UnityPy`, `pygltflib`, `numpy`, `Pillow`
  (`pip install -r tools/model_extractor/requirements.txt`) for the one-time
  model extraction — **dev only**; release builds ship a frozen extractor.
- A local Project: Gorgon install (auto-detected via Steam).

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev      # full app (Vite + Tauri)
# or, frontend only:
npm run dev
```

Backend checks / tests:

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo test --lib        # includes the appearance parser + base-body unit tests
```

## Install (users)

Grab the installer for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/crisp-oddio/pg-model-viewer/releases/latest):
Windows `-setup.exe`, macOS `.dmg` (Apple Silicon), Linux `.deb` / `.AppImage`.
Release builds bundle the model extractor — no Python needed.

## Release (maintainers)

Actions → **Release** → Run workflow → choose `patch`/`minor`/`major` or an
explicit `x.y.z`. The workflow bumps the version, tags, freezes the extractor
sidecar per platform, builds all installers, and publishes the GitHub Release.

## First run

1. Launch the app. It fetches `items.json` and shows the item picker.
2. Click **Extract models** — a one-time (~1 min) extraction from your local
   install into `{appdata}/models/`.
3. Pick a slot + item to view it; toggle **Character** for the paper doll.

> **Note:** the extraction spawns `python` on your PATH. The Microsoft-Store
> Python is sandboxed and cannot write `%APPDATA%\Roaming` — if extraction
> fails, use a non-Store Python (python.org) or pre-seed the cache.

## Known limitations / follow-ups

- **Weapons in Character mode** aren't placed in-hand yet (item-mode turntable
  shows them fine).
- **Loadouts aren't persisted** yet, and dye edits reset on rebuild — both land
  with a saved-preset feature.
- Base body is a static bind/A-pose (no skeleton/animation); hair and appearance
  flags (`Hair=Off`, `Bra=off`, …) aren't rendered.
- Drop-source data (which monster drops an item) was glogger-specific and is not
  included here.
